# About

tld_db is a full TLD and IDN collection that separates the ARPA, gTLD, grTLD, sTLD, ccTLD, and tTLD.
But indeed made all the toplevel readable in one file as well. 


# Story

I faced a problem with the domain names. I tried to find a solution in multiple ways. 
For years I was happy with the https://github.com/john-kurkowski/tldextract. However, in code level and service level are not even close to my requirements.
